## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

With this challenge I believe I have broken the barrier to enter the world of SCSS. At first I got stuck and frustrated especially with the nesting. Then I got more and more comfortable. Although I'm not entirely sure if I have used it well. 

I comment this because in the .css file (compiled) there are very long nesting and I don't think it's normal. Next I put an example:

The code is this:


```css
html body .wraper .article .section_bottom .bottom_prices {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In this challenge I think I have improved with the class names.
